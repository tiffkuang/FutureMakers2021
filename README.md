## Reflection Responses

Day 3
1. Supervised learning is when the machine receives both the data points and labels, and learns from feedback. There are two main types of outcomes in supervised learning: regression and classification. In unsupervised learning, the machine only receives data points and is expected to learn from patterns, such as clustering, rather than feedback.
2. The statemnt "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false because Scikit Learn is not focused on manipulating or visualizing the data. Instead, Scikit-Learn is used only for machine learning calculations and models. The other libraries, such as NumPy, Graphviz, and Pandas, is used to visualize the data.

Day 7
1. Tensors are multidimensional arrays. It is essentially inputted data with a certain amount of features. In Machine Learning, tensors are used to quicken the process because with tensors, the feature doesn't have to be passed over and over again. Instead, tensors combine all of the data points into a single matrix that is only called once.
