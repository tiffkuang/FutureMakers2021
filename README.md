## Reflection Responses

Day 3
1. Supervised learning is when the machine receives both the data points and labels, and learns from feedback. There are two main types of outcomes in supervised learning: regression and classification. In unsupervised learning, the machine only receives data points and is expected to learn from patterns, such as clustering, rather than feedback.
2. The statemnt "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false because Scikit Learn is not focused on manipulating or visualizing the data. Instead, Scikit-Learn is used only for machine learning calculations and models. The other libraries, such as NumPy, Graphviz, and Pandas, is used to visualize the data.

Day 4
- I looked at 3 different types of facial datasets, including Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes, Labeled Faces in the Wild by UMass-Amherst, and Flickr Faces HQ Dataset. 
1. In the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes database, I see that a majority of the images are of white young adult females or older white males. These pictures date back about a decade. There are only a small percentage of people of color in these images. Additionally, a portion of these iamges contain photoshop editing. However, this database has a variety of features that are specific to the images, such as images of people with sunglasses, hats, bangs, oval faces, and pointy noses. Although there is a variety physical features specific to a group of images, the database still lacks a diverse range of ethnicities. 
2. In the Labeled Faces in the Wild by UMass-Amherst database, it contains mostly older white people, including well-known athletes, celebrities, and men in tuxedos. There are only a few people of color, but all of them are celebrities. All of these iamges are taken off-guard as none of them are headshots. All of the younger white females had brown hair. All of the older white females had short blond haircuts. One thing that this dataset had that the others didn't were images of twins. This dataset lacks diverse images from the present, and diversity within each set of images. For example, the dataset could have included younger females with different hair colors other than brown. 
3. The Flickr Faces HQ Dataset was by far the best and most diverse dataset out of the three datasets. It contains pictures of all ages, from babies to grandparents. It also contains pictures of a diverse range of ethnicities, including caucasians, east asians, and africans. However, all of these images appear to be headshots instead of off guard. The faces in these images are clear whereas the background of these images are blurred.

1. Tensors are multidimensional arrays. It is essentially inputted data with a certain amount of features. In Machine Learning, tensors are used to quicken the process because with tensors, the feature doesn't have to be passed over and over again. Instead, tensors combine all of the data points into a single matrix that is only called once.
