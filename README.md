1. Supervised learning is when the machine receives both the data points and labels, and learns from feedback. There are two main types of outcomes in supervised learning: regression and classification. In unsupervised learning, the machine only receives data points and is expected to learn from patterns, such as clustering, rather than feedback.

1. Tensors are multidimensional arrays. It is essentially inputted data with a certain amount of features. In Machine Learning, tensors are used to quicken the process because with tensors, the feature doesn't have to be passed over and over again. Instead, tensors combine all of the data points into a single matrix that is only called once.
